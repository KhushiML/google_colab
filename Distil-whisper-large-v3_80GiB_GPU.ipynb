      " Now, it's time. May I start the presentation on transforming Toshiba to enhance your health value and FY21 second quarter consolidated business results. We are organized this presentation session on online basis. From 4 to 5 o'clock, we will be presenting from our side and followed by 30 minutes' question session for the middle of the media. The questions from Alice And investors will be accepted from 5.30 to 6 o'clock Japan time. Please be aware of that. Now, we will be collecting questions via telephone conferencing system. As is informed you beforehand, the conference call system will require the pre-registration beforehand. Let me introduce the presenter today. President and CEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa. Corporate Senior Executive Vice President, Mamor Hatazawa. Representative Executive Executive Vice President, Corporate Executive Vice President, NCFO, Masei Hiraeta. We have a chairperson of Strategic Review Committee outside director of Paul Broff. He is joining from Hong Kong on online. My name is Hara of Communications, Corporate Communication Department. We are providing simultaneous transition, so if you are watching the live streaming in Japanese, you will be able to hear translation's voice. Please be aware of that. First, before going into transforming Toshiba to enhance Heharo's value, may I have Mr. Tunaka to say a few words upon the receipt of the report from governance enhancement committee. today. Mr. Sunakawa, please. Now, first of all, I'd like to say a few words on behalf of the company upon the report of the Government and Ensenancement Committee. First off, I'd like to express profound appreciation to the members of the Governor Enhancing Committee who have made tremendous efforts and time since their appointment to investigate the root codes of the issue raised in the investigation report, clarify where the responsibility lies and compile recommendations for formulating the measures to repent recurrent. I recognize that the Toshiba's governance enhancement committee, based on the strong belief that restructuring of the governance is essential for the revival of the Toshiba, has compiled a report for our future. In fact, no issue of illegality was discovered, according to the report of the government enhancement committee. Having said that, I feel as a part of the senior management of the company, I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the, the senior members of the company and their actions was concluded that an act as a whole violates the corporate ethics demanded by the market. We have just received a final report of the governance Enhance Committee, but we will continue to discuss the governance seriously within the company based on the contents of the report, including recommendations for the formulation of the recurrence prevention measures. We believe that this recurrence prevention measures will form the very first step to restore the trust of the shareholders which have been restored so far. Now, one of the group's philosophy is doing the right thing. Many employees on the front lines of the operations are working day-to-day based on this value. On the other hand, I believe that some of the members of the Singe Management were acted quite differently from this philosophy, and that should be sincerely remorse over. The corporate management is established based on the trust relationship with all stakeholders. The Governor and Assessment Committee also pointed out that the importance of top-at-the-ton and organizational leaders demonstrating their commitment to value, ethics, and integrity. Until now, the culture to recognize the mistakes and the very good communication so that anyone can raise opinions escalated. higher level, but also we need to ensure the psychological safety of all employees. We will make persistent efforts in this regard. As I will announce today, our group decided to separate the energy infrastructure business and storage device business sets. There will be the separate companies and aim for the IPOs, accept independently. This is a drastic change, but because these business will be separated and being independent, and therefore, the committed to people and committed to the future, based on this philosophy, under the new corporate culture, each business is poised to grow, and this is a great opportunity. But beforehand, it is a critical mission of the senior management to enhance governance beforehand. I appreciate your continued support and asking for your cooperation. Thank you very much. Next, we'd like to present on the transforming Toshiba to enhance shareholders' value, and Mr. Tuna Kawa will make presentations. Next, I'd like to explain on our new management policy titled as Transforming Toshiba to Enhense Shelders value. The corporate executive vice president, Hatazawa, will also be presenting, and also on online, the chairperson of Strategic Review Committee, Mr. Paul, will also be attending as well. Now, today, Toshiba Group has decided on its significant transformation to further lead forward for the future. Let me first introduce why this is the best path forward for Toshiba and our shareholders and what it means for our business going forward. And then we would like to invite Mr. Brough to explain on the evaluation made by the Strategic Review Committee. After that, Mr. Hadza will talk on what the business outlook will be for the standalone companies after separation. First, about our path to unlocking the value that I'd like to explain. Now, at the Board of Directorial meeting held this morning, decision was made for Toshiba's strategic reorganization to separate the business into two businesses. As a result, there will be three standalone companies to be formulated. One is infrastructure service company. Second is device company. and the third is Toshiba. As we conclude, thus, strategic reorganization to be the best path forward for Toshiba and their stakeholders, we took into account the view of our important shareholders and other key stakeholders, as well as the business characteristics and the value chain of each of our diverse businesses. Over our history of over 140 years, Toshiba has constantly evolved to stay ahead of the times. Today's announcement is no different. Toshiba has built a portfolio of leading businesses, but in order to enhance our competitive positioning, each business needs greater flexibility to address its own market opportunities and challenges. The official names for the new companies will be announced in due course. Here is an overview of the three independent businesses. Infrastructure service company will consist of Toshiba and energy systems and solutions, infrastructure systems and solutions, building solutions, digital solutions, and battery businesses, and become a company with the forecasted net sales of 2.1 trillion yen according to this fiscal year's forecast. Its increased focus combined with its innovative technological solutions will enable it to play a lean role in driving the transition to ringable energy to meet ambitious global carbon neutrality goals and advancing infrastructure to resilience as a leading player. Device company will be comprised of Toshiba electric device and storage solutions business and become a company with forecasted net sales of 870 billion yen. Its products will be including power semiconductors, high-capacity, hard disk drives, HDD for data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It will be a global leader in supporting the evolution of, social and IT infrastructure. Toshiba will continue to hold the company's ownership stake in Kiyokshia Holding Corporation and Toshab Tech Corporation. Kosovo will seek to monetize the share of Kiyokshia at an appropriate timing. The separation this time enables us to better align each new companies by its unique business characteristics. Infrastructure service company related to the technology. business focus on the direct sale of equipment and the provision of solutions to specific customers. It has long business cycles that are more heavily dependent on negotiations between business parties than the market conditions at large. In addition, it will be a capital light business, and there are also major differences to the extent in which we conduct customized production. In contrast, device company primarily, manufactures and sales devices such as semiconductors and other materials, its business cycles are shorter and can be impacted significantly by the market conditions. It will be a capital-intensive business that requires scale of continuous production across multiple customer orders. And relatively...\n",

Mr. Sunakawa, please. Now, first of all, I'd like to say a few words on behalf of the company upon the report of the Government and Ensenancement Committee. First off, I'd like to express profound appreciation to the members of the Governor Enhancing Committee who have made tremendous efforts and time since their appointment to investigate the root codes of the issue raised in the investigation report, clarify where the responsibility lies and compile recommendations for formulating the measures to repent recurrent. I recognize that the Toshiba's governance enhancement committee, based on the strong belief that restructuring of the governance is essential for the revival of the Toshiba, has compiled a report for our future. In fact, no issue of illegality was discovered, according to the report of the government enhancement committee. Having said that, I feel as a part of the senior management of the company, I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the, the senior members of the company and their actions was concluded that an act as a whole violates the corporate ethics demanded by the market. We have just received a final report of the governance Enhance Committee, but we will continue to discuss the governance seriously within the company based on the contents of the report, including recommendations for the formulation of the recurrence prevention measures.

In fact, tragically, two soldiers have died in the line of duty. In fact, several other soldiers have been injured as well. There was a brief gunfight is what we can report at this moment in Jammu and Kishmir's Kistvahar and two soldiers have died. Of course, these are soldiers leading from the front and they've been killed in the line of action. Absolutely tragic there. And this comes after. There was a major arms hall as well in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. And the timing of the encounter is also extremely important given the fact that this comes right ahead of the assembly polls. The assembly pole is just a week away. Less than a week away perhaps the first phase will be held on the 18th of September. So extremely concerning there. and most tragic the fact that two soldiers have died in this gun battle.\n",

      " We are struggling with some issues. There's a big debate in our country about manufacturing. Now the fact is, I mean there are people who would say, why we're importing so much from China? Part of it is because we neglected manufacturing through the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s, maybe even the first decade of 2000. When, I mean, think back, I mean, all of you are as connected and have as good a memory about our country as our country as I'm. what our country is, I do. When did we actually have governments who made a major push on manufacturing? And yet there are people who today come and say, no, we need to find a fix, as though it's something you can do in Stentenously. And rather, by the way, people who actually also say that we're incapable of it. We should not even attempt it. So, now ask yourself, can you actually be a major power in the world without manufacturing? Because a major power needs technology. Nobody can develop technology without developing manufacturing. But yet you have that strain of thought also. So as I said, you know, it's, it requires, until we develop the human resources, it requires hard work, until you build the infrastructure, until you have those policies. So life is not khattakht. Life is hard work. Life is diligence. Anybody who's held a job and labelled at it, knows it.\n",

      " On this former industrial site in Whitehaven, Cumbria, planned to produce 60 million tons of new coal. But since it was approved, a Supreme Court ruling found projects must consider carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, not just digging them up. The mine was the first legal test of that. It's been a really important victory. But what frustrates me most is that the years the decision makers have been putting all their efforts and fighting for a coal mine in Whitehaven, they could have spent that time investing in green jobs. It was mining jobs the community expected. This site has sat empty for 20 years. It's devastating for the community. The jobs that were going to be created were possibly in the construction and supply chain surrounding it were probably around 2,000. And the long-term, well-paid jobs for running the facility were in excess of 500. The new government has been clear about its net zero ambitions, but judgments like this one could test them.

And there's much more of this graphic type of contact. In fact, Sky News has seen 72,000 posts used in this way. Not only is that number big, but the level of engagement is high too. Between them, these posts have racked up 21 million likes, showing people are engaging with the videos. Well, how are they engaging? This is a good example, an image of a Nuremberg rally, accompanied by a Hitler speech. It's been liked by more than 56,000 users. And in a comment, there's been liked 1,695 times, one user states, modern society needs him. Another says, we miss you. It's difficult to know the motivations of the people posting it.
