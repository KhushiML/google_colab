You will also be provided with a text content which could be relevantfor the information gathering.\n \nCategories:\n \nPersonality: A well-known public figure such as a politician, actor, or other celebrity. Consider their facial features, attire, and the likelihood of them appearing in this context.\nAnchor: A news anchor who presents the news from the studio. Look for professional attire, the presence of a news desk, and any background elements like studio graphics.\nReporter: A journalist who reports news, often live from the location of the event. Identify outdoor settings, microphones, and on-the-ground reporting visuals.\nGuest: An individual invited to speak on a specific topic, often for their expertise or experience. Look for individuals in interview settings, either in-studio or remotely, and context clues like lower-third titles or related graphics.\n \nAnalysis Instructions:\n\nAnalyze the persons you are getting from the text content. If you are able to identify the person from a frame, categorize them, and if there is a crowd or if you are unable to process the frame, mark it as UNKNOWN.\n \nContextual Analysis: Assess the environment, such as studio settings, outdoor locations, or interview formats, which may provide clues about the individual's role.\nIdentifying Details: Look for facial recognition hints, attire (e.g., suits, casual wear, field gear), and accessories like microphones or earpieces.\nText Analysis: Analyze any associated text that might provide context, such as subtitles, banners, or on-screen information.\nName Recognition: Consider the provided name of the person and cross-reference it with the visual information.\nVisual Cues: Consider background elements like text overlays, graphics, or any identifying markers (e.g., studio logos, live report banners).\nKnown Figures: If the person is a well-known public figure, utilize your knowledge to assist in classification.\nPurpose of Appearance: Evaluate the likely reason the individual is on screenâ€”are they delivering news, providing commentary, or being interviewed?\n\nText support: There could be supported text provided for the image clip, accounting in that you have to identify the person name and profession,if possible.If name is present in text content and also you are likely able to identify from the image, return that name along with category.\nImage support: Identify the name of the person from the context of the image.\n \nEdge cases:\n1) There can be more than one person in the image;

You will also be provided with text content which could be relevant for the information gathering.\n \nCategories:\n\nPersonality: A well-known public figure such as a politician, actor, or other celebrity. Consider their facial features, attire, and the likelihood of them appearing in this context.\n\nAnchor: A news anchor who presents the news from the studio. Look for professional attire, the presence of a news desk, and any background elements like studio graphics.\n\nReporter: A journalist who actively reports the news, often live from the event location. Reporters typically hold a microphone or other visible journalistic tools (e.g., notepad, camera, earpiece) and are often labeled on-screen with titles such as \"LIVE REPORT\" or similar. They are often in field gear or professionally dressed for the outdoors and may have a visible news logo. Avoid classifying politicians or public figures giving interviews or speeches as reporters. Individuals in advertisements or crowds should not be classified as reporters unless identified as part of a news report.\n\nGuest: An individual invited to speak on a specific topic, often for their expertise or experience. Look for individuals in interview settings, either in-studio or remotely, and context clues like lower-third titles or related graphics.\n\nCrowd: A group of individuals or bystanders in the background of the image who are not the focus of the news report and are not holding a microphone or journalistic tools.\n\nAnalysis Instructions:\n\nAnalyze the persons you are getting from the text content. If you are able to identify the person from a frame, categorize them, and if there is a crowd or if you are unable to process the frame, mark it as UNKNOWN.\n \nContextual Analysis: Assess the environment, such as studio settings, outdoor locations, or interview formats, which may provide clues about the individual's role.\nIdentifying Details: Look for facial recognition hints, attire (e.g., suits, casual wear, field gear), and accessories like microphones or earpieces.\nText Analysis: Analyze any associated text that might provide context, such as subtitles, banners, or on-screen information.\nName Recognition: Consider the provided name of the person and cross-reference it with the visual information.\nVisual Cues: Consider background elements like text overlays, graphics, or any identifying markers (e.g., studio logos, live report banners).\nKnown Figures: If the person is a well-known public figure, utilize your knowledge to assist in classification.\nPurpose of Appearance: Evaluate the likely reason the individual is on screenâ€”are they delivering news, providing commentary, or being interviewed?\n\nText support: There could be supported text provided for the image clip, accounting in that you have to identify the person name and profession, if possible. If the name is present in text content and also you are likely able to identify from the image, return that name along with category.\nImage support: Identify the name of the person from the context of the image.\n \nEdge cases:\n1) There can be more than one person in the image; you have to analyze and tell for all the persons.\n\nResponse Format:\n- Name: [identified person name]\n- Category: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\nIf the personality name is not identified, send the response in the following format:\n\nName: Unknown\nCategory: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\"\"\"\n\ndef categorize(frame_url, text_content):\n    try:\n        # Fetch the image from the frame URL\n        response = requests.get(frame_url)\n        img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))\n\n        # Convert image to base64 string\n        buffered = BytesIO()\n        img.save(buffered, format=\"JPEG\")\n        encoded_image = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode('ascii')\n        \n        \n            # Generate the prompt using the provided name\n        full_prompt = f\"{prompt_template}\\n\\nText Content: {text_content}\"\n\n            # Prepare the payload for the GPT-4V API\n        payload = {\n            \"messages\": [\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": full_prompt},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"image_url\",\n                        \"image_url\": {\n                            \"url\": f\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{encoded_image}\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                ]}\n            ]\n        }\n\n            # Send the request to the GPT-4V API\n        api_response = requests.post(GPT4V_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, json=payload).json()\n        \n        #print(frame_url)\n\n            # Extract name and category from the API response\n        classification = api_response.get('choices', [{}])[0].get('message', {}).get('content', 'No classification')\n        print(f\"Classification: {classification}\")\n\n            # Parse the name and category from the classification response\n        name_match = re.search(r\"Name:\\s*([A-Za-z\\s]+)(?=\\n|$)\", classification)\n        #name_match = re.search(r\"Name: ([\\w\\s]+)\", classification)\n        category_match = re.search(r\"Category: (\\w+)\", classification)\n            \n        if name_match and category_match:\n            name = name_match.group(1)\n            category = category_match.group(1)\n            clean_name = name.strip().upper()\n            return clean_name, category\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to extract name or category for {frame_url}.\")\n            return \"Unknown\", \"Unknown\"\n\n\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching or processing the frame: {e}\")\n        return \"Unknown\", \"Unknown\"\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-03T10:25:25.628528Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-03T10:25:25.629123Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-03T10:25:25.648963Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-03T10:25:25.629084Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-03T10:25:25.648137Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1st ID","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Example image URL and text content\nframe_url = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/imagestg-bucket/Image/1010119_2024-10-01_08-01-49.jpg\"  # Replace with an actual image URL\ntext_content = \"\"\"\nJNK polls enter its final phase polling to take place in 40 seats today security heightened in  ahead of final phase of\n\"\"\"  # Replace with any relevant text content\n\n# Call the function to test the image URL with text content\nname, category = categorize(frame_url, text_content)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Name: {name}\")\nprint(f\"Category: {category}\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-03T10:34:57.112028Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-03T10:34:57.112879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-03T10:35:04.149982Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-03T10:34:57.112827Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-03T10:35:04.149069Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Classification: The provided image does not show an individual but rather appears to be a transitional or title screen from the news broadcast by Republic TV concerning the final phase of J&K polls.

You will also be provided with text content that could be relevant for gathering information.\n\nCategories:\n\n- Personality: A well-known public figure such as a politician, actor, or other celebrity. Consider their facial features, attire, and the likelihood of them appearing in this context. Generally, politicians are in white attire.\n\n- Anchor: A news anchor who presents the news from the studio. Look for professional attire, the presence of a news desk, and any background elements like studio graphics. **If there are multiple anchor images shown in the bottom part of the image frame, ignore them for classification.**\n\n- Reporter: A journalist who actively reports the news, often live from the event location. Reporters typically hold a microphone or other visible journalistic tools (e.g., notepad, camera, earpiece) and are often labeled on-screen with titles such as \"LIVE REPORT\" or similar. They are often in field gear or professionally dressed for the outdoors and may have a visible news logo. Avoid classifying politicians or public figures giving interviews or speeches as reporters. Individuals in advertisements or crowds should not be classified as reporters unless identified as part of a news report.\n\n- Guest: An individual invited to speak on a specific topic, often for their expertise or experience. Look for individuals in interview settings, either in-studio or remotely, and context clues like lower-third titles or related graphics.\n\n- Crowd: A group of individuals or bystanders in the background of the image who are not the focus of the news report and are not holding a microphone or journalistic tools.\n\nAnalysis Instructions:\n\n1. Analyze the persons you are getting from the text content. If you are able to identify the person from a frame, categorize them, and if there is a crowd or if you are unable to process the frame, mark it as UNKNOWN.\n\n2. Contextual Analysis: Assess the environment, such as studio settings, outdoor locations, or interview formats, which may provide clues about the individual's role.\n\n3. Identifying Details: Look for facial recognition hints, attire (e.g., suits, casual wear, field gear), and accessories like microphones or earpieces.\n\n4. Text Analysis: Analyze any associated text that might provide context, such as subtitles, banners, or on-screen information.\n\n5. Name Recognition: Consider the provided name of the person and cross-reference it with the visual information.\n\n6. Visual Cues: Consider background elements like text overlays, graphics, or any identifying markers (e.g., studio logos, live report banners).\n\n7. Known Figures: If the person is a well-known public figure, utilize your knowledge to assist in classification.\n\n8. Purpose of Appearance: Evaluate the likely reason the individual is on screenâ€”are they delivering news, providing commentary, or being interviewed?\n\nText Support:\n\n- You may be provided with additional text relevant to the image clip. Use it to identify the personâ€™s name and profession, if possible. If the name is present in the text and matches the image, return that name along with the category.\n\nImage Support:\n\n- Identify the name of the person from the context of the image (e.g., their appearance, attire, background).\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- If there is more than one person in the image, analyze and classify each individual.\n\nResponse Format:\n\nFor each identified person, return the information in this format:\n\n- Name: [identified person name]\n- Category: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\nIf the personality name is not identified, return the response in the following format:\n\n- Name: Unknown\n- Category: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\"\"\"\ndef categorize(frame_url, text_content):\n    try:\n        # Fetch the image from the frame URL\n        response = requests.get(frame_url)\n        img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))\n\n        # Convert image to base64 string\n        buffered = BytesIO()\n        img.save(buffered, format=\"JPEG\")\n        encoded_image = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode('ascii')\n        \n        \n            # Generate the prompt using the provided name\n        full_prompt = f\"{prompt_template}\\n\\nText Content: {text_content}\"\n\n            # Prepare the payload for the GPT-4V API\n        payload = {\n            \"messages\": [\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": full_prompt},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"image_url\",\n                        \"image_url\": {\n                            \"url\": f\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{encoded_image}\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                ]}\n            ]\n        }\n\n            # Send the request to the GPT-4V API\n        api_response = requests.post(GPT4V_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, json=payload).json()\n        \n        #print(frame_url)\n\n            # Extract name and category from the API response\n        classification = api_response.get('choices', [{}])[0].get('message', {}).get('content', 'No classification')\n        print(f\"Classification: {classification}\")\n\n            # Parse the name and category from the classification response\n        name_match = re.search(r\"Name:\\s*([A-Za-z\\s]+)(?=\\n|$)\", classification)\n        #name_match = re.search(r\"Name: ([\\w\\s]+)\", classification)\n        category_match = re.search(r\"Category: (\\w+)\", classification)\n            \n        if name_match and category_match:\n            name = name_match.group(1)\n            category = category_match.group(1)\n            clean_name = name.strip().upper()\n            return clean_name, category\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to extract name or category for {frame_url}.\")\n            return \"Unknown\", \"Unknown\"\n\n\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching or processing the frame: {e}\")\n        return \"Unknown\", \"Unknown\"\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-04T06:16:56.684953Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-04T06:16:56.685313Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-04T06:17:18.565222Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-04T06:16:56.685276Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-04T06:17:18.564395Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1st Id","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Example image URL and text content\nframe_url = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/imagestg-bucket/Image/1010119_2024-10-01_08-01-49.jpg\"  # Replace with an actual image URL\ntext_content = \"\"\"\nJNK polls enter its final phase polling to take place in 40 seats today security heightened in  ahead of final phase of\n\"\"\"  # Replace with any relevant text content\n\n# Call the function to test the image URL with text content\nname, category = categorize(frame_url, text_content)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Name: {name}\")\nprint(f\"Category: {category}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-03T11:29:24.139635Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-03T11:29:24.140494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-03T11:29:34.580422Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-03T11:29:24.140451Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-03T11:29:34.579485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Classification: The provided image does not display any individuals, only graphics related to a news broadcast.

You will also be provided with text content that could be relevant for information gathering.\n\nCategories:\n\n- **Personality:** A well-known public figure such as a politician, actor, or celebrity. Politicians are typically dressed in white attire. Consider their facial features and likelihood of appearing in this context.\n\n- **Anchor:** A news anchor who presents news from the studio. Look for professional attire and a news desk. If multiple anchors are present at the bottom of the frame without a clear leader, classify as UNKNOWN rather than Anchor.\n\n- **Reporter:** A journalist actively reporting news from an event location. Reporters typically hold a microphone or have visible journalistic tools (e.g., notepad, camera, earpiece) and are often labeled on-screen with titles such as \"LIVE REPORT.\" Avoid classifying politicians giving interviews as reporters.\n\n- **Guest:** An individual invited to discuss a topic, often shown in interview settings with lower-third titles or related graphics.\n\n- **Crowd:** A group of individuals or bystanders in the background who are not the focus of the news report and are not holding a microphone or journalistic tools.\n\nAnalysis Instructions:\n\n1. **Identification:** Analyze the persons in the text content. If you can identify the person from the frame, categorize them. If there is a crowd or if you are unable to process the frame, mark it as UNKNOWN.\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis:** Assess the environment, such as studio settings or outdoor locations, for clues about the individual's role.\n\n3. **Identifying Details:** Look for facial recognition hints, attire, and accessories like microphones or earpieces.\n\n4. **Text Analysis:** Analyze any associated text that might provide context, such as subtitles or banners.\n\n5. **Name Recognition:** Cross-reference any provided names with the visual information.\n\n6. **Visual Cues:** Consider background elements like text overlays or studio logos.\n\n7. **Known Figures:** Utilize knowledge of well-known public figures for classification.\n\n8. **Purpose of Appearance:** Determine if the individual is delivering news, providing commentary, or being interviewed.\n\nText support: There could be supported text provided for the image clip. If the name is present in the text content and you can identify the person from the image, return that name along with the category. \n\nImage support: Identify the name of the person based on the context of the image.\n\nEdge cases:\n1. There can be multiple individuals in the image. Analyze and categorize each person.\n2. If unsure about classification, lean towards marking as UNKNOWN instead of forcing a classification.\n\nResponse Format:\n- Name: [identified person name]\n- Category: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\nIf the personality name is not identified, send the response in the following format:\n\nName: Unknown\nCategory: [Personality/Anchor/Reporter/Guest/Crowd]\n\"\"\"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
